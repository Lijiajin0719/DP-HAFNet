# DP-HAFNet

DO-HAFNet is a novel deep learning framework for high-quality ultrasound image reconstruction from single plane-wave radio frequency (RF) data. This network features a dual-output architecture that simultaneously predicts pixel-level adaptive weights and channel-weighted beamforming outputs, enabling superior image quality while maintaining computational efficiency.
